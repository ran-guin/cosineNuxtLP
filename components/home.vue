            p Cosine was set up to provide public institutions and the broader community with cost-effective, but highly functional web applications.
            p We welcome collaborations with government or socially focused institutions that have interesting ideas for leveraging technology for positive social impact.
            p We regularly work with new development frameworks that provide valuable tools for rapidly developing powerful data visualization interfaces.
            p We are also dedicated to designing products in a transparent way that maximizes transparency, scalability and flexibility.  As such, we make databases, APIs, and source code available to clients & collaborators for  ongoing use.
